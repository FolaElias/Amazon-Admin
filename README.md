# Amazon-Admin

E-Commerce Super Admin Management Dashboard is a lightweight web application designed to simplify the management of an online snacks and pastries platform. Built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a clean, interactive dashboard for administrators to oversee products, orders, distributors, and sales — all in one place.

The system allows admins to add, edit, or remove products, monitor orders received by distributors based on location, and assign or reassign distributors efficiently. A dedicated super admin panel tracks total sales, offering insights into business performance and distributor activity.

Its simple architecture demonstrates how robust and dynamic web apps can be built without frameworks, focusing on maintainability, clarity, and responsiveness. The dashboard layout is intuitive, ensuring that admins can perform critical tasks—such as updating inventory, managing distributors, and tracking orders—with minimal effort.
